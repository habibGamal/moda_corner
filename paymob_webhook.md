Manage Callback
Welcome to the Manage Callback documentation! In this section, we'll guide you through the different types of transaction callbacks that are essential for handling payment processing and ensuring a seamless integration with your system. Specifically, we'll cover transaction processed callbacks, transaction response callbacks, and how to calculate HMAC for processed callbacks, redirection callbacks, and saved card token objects.

You will learn how to configure and manage these callbacks, understand their role in transaction flow, and ensure that your system securely processes and responds to different events during payment transactions. Whether you're dealing with successful payments, handling failures, or managing tokenized card data, this guide will provide you with the necessary tools and knowledge to handle callbacks efficiently and securely.

Let's dive into understanding each callback type and how to calculate and implement HMAC to ensure the integrity and security of your transactions.

Transaction Callbacks
What is a Transaction Callback?
A transaction callback is a notification sent from our system to your web application whenever a customer performs a transaction or takes any action related to a transaction (e.g., Void, Refund, Pay, etc.), regardless of the transaction type. This webhook request is triggered to inform you about the status of the transaction.

There are two types of transaction callbacks:

Transaction Processed Callback
Transaction Response Callback
To learn how to set up your callback endpoints, please refer to the Payment Integration Guide.

Transaction Processed Callback
This is a URL endpoint in your web application where you will receive notifications after a customer completes any payment process. The callback will be sent as a POST request containing a JSON object with key details about the transaction. This allows you to track important information such as the transaction status (success/declined), the related order ID, transaction ID, and other relevant data related to the payment.

Here is an example of a request (shown on the right side) that you would receive on your transaction-processed callback endpoint for a successful transaction. While you don’t need to use all the keys included, the table below describes some of the key details within the callback object:

Key
Description
id

The unique identifier for this transaction. You can find this ID in the "Transaction" tab of your Merchant portal

pending

A boolean value indicates the status of this transaction, determining whether it is pending or not. The transaction will be considered pending in the following cases:

Card Payments: The customer has been redirected to the issuing bank's page to enter their OTP.
Kiosk Payments: A payment reference number has been generated, and the payment is still pending.
Cash Payments: The cash payment is ready to be collected, and the courier is on their way to pick it up from the customer.
success

A boolean value indicates the status of this transaction, determining whether it is successful or not. It will be true if the customer has successfully completed the payment, in which case the transaction is considered successfully processed.

If success = false, there are two possible scenarios:

If pending = true, the transaction is considered pending.
If pending = false, the transaction is considered declined.
is_auth

A boolean value indicates the status of this transaction, determining whether it is authorized or not. This refers to whether an authorization request was made, typically part of an "Auth/Cap" transaction flow.

is_capture

A boolean value indicates the status of this transaction, determining whether it is captured or not. This is part of the authorization and capture (Auth/Cap) process, where funds are captured after authorization.

amount_cents

An integer indicating the amount paid in this transaction, represented in cents. This amount may differ from the original order price.

is_voided

A boolean value indicates the status of this transaction, determining whether it is captured or not. If set totrue , this transaction has been voided. The void process is where the transaction is effectively reversed before the funds are captured.

is_refunded

A boolean value indicates the status of this transaction, determining whether it is refunded or not. If set totrue , this transaction has been refunded. The refund process is where the funds are returned after the transaction has been completed.

is_3d_secure

A boolean value indicates the status of this transaction, determining whether it is 3D secure or not. If set totrue , this transaction has been 3d secured.

integration_id

An integer that represents the ID of the payment method used to process this transaction.

billing_data

An object containing the billing information related to the customer. This typically includes the customer's billing address, phone number, email, and other relevant details required for processing the payment.

billing_data[first_name]

A string value representing the customer's first name. This is part of the customer’s personal information associated with the transaction in the billing data object.

billing_data[last_name]

A string value representing the customer's last name. This is part of the customer’s personal information associated with the transaction in the billing data object.

billing_data[email]

A string value representing the customer's phone number in the billing data object.

billing_data[phone_number]

A string value representing the customer's email address in the billing data object.

order

This is a JSON sub-object that contains the order data related to this transaction.

order[id]

The unique identifier of the order. You can find this ID in the "Order" tab of your Merchant portal.

order[created_at]

A string representing the date and time when the order was created.

order[delivery_needed]

A boolean value indicates whether the order requires delivery through Accept's Order Delivery Services.

order[amount_cents]

An integer representing the original price of the order, in cents.

order[shipping_data}

A sub-object containing the shipping information for the order, if delivery is required. This data was originally prefilled in your order registration request.

order[merchant_order_id]

A string representing the reference to the order in your system's database. This value was provided during the order registration request. For Shopify Transactions, the Shopify Payment ID is passed in it.

order[paid_amount_cents]

An integer representing the amount paid for the order, in cents. It should match the amount_cents value of the associated transaction.

currency

A string representing the currency used for the payment integration of this transaction.

discount_details [discount_amount_cents

An integer value representing the amount of discount in the discount details object applied to the order amount.

data[down_payment]

An integer value represents the down payment amount for the transaction, in cents in the data object.

Payment Method source_data[type]

This indicates the type of payment method used for the transaction in the source data object.

Transaction Response Callback
After a customer completes a payment, you should redirect them back to your platform with a clear message indicating the status of the payment they just made.

The transaction response callback consists of a set of query parameters that we append to the URL of your endpoint. After the payment is processed, we will redirect the customer to this endpoint. You can then parse these parameters and display an appropriate message to the customer based on the payment status.

These query parameters correspond to the same keys found in the transaction processed callback JSON object.

Useful Testing Tools
To receive transaction callbacks, your app must be deployed on a publicly accessible endpoint. If you are developing your app locally and need to test receiving callbacks, you may need to set up a secure, introspectable tunnel to your localhost webhook. One recommended tool for this is ngrok, which generates a public URL that you can use as your callback URL.

If you are not receiving callbacks and need to debug the issue, you can use one of the following HTTP request inspection tools: Webhook, RequestBin, or RequestWatch. These tools generate endpoint URLs that you can add to your transaction processed/response callbacks, allowing you to verify whether the callbacks are being received after a payment is processed.

HMAC
HMAC Introduction
HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a widely used cryptographic technique designed to ensure both the integrity and authenticity of a message. It combines a cryptographic hash function (such as SHA-512) with a secret key and a string of data to produce a unique signature, known as an HMAC. This signature serves as a guarantee that the message has not been altered during transmission and confirms the identity of the sender.

HMAC Authentication
HMAC authentication is employed to secure communication between systems by ensuring that the data remains unaltered and authentic. It verifies the sender's identity and confirms that the data has not been tampered with during transmission. In the case of Accept, HMAC authentication is used to validate every callback sent to your server. Each callback from Accept’s server includes its own specific HMAC validation, and the methodology for calculating the HMAC remains consistent across all callbacks. Once you implement the HMAC calculation for one callback, you can apply the same process to others seamlessly.

Steps to Calculate and Validate the HMAC
Whenever you receive a callback from Accept, it will include an HMAC value associated with the data received in the request. This HMAC value is sent as a query parameter named hmac. To verify the authenticity of the callback, you need to calculate the HMAC based on the data you received and compare it with the HMAC value sent by Accept. Follow these steps to calculate and validate the HMAC:

Step 1: Sort the Data Lexicographically by Key
Sort the parameters received in the callback in lexicographical order based on their keys.

Step 2: Concatenate the Values
Depending on the type of callback received, concatenate the values of the keys/parameters into a single string. This string will be used to calculate the HMAC in the next step.

Step 3: Get the HMAC Value
Obtain the HMAC value from the Merchant Portal settings tab. Use this Hmac value as the secret key in the following steps.

Step 4: Calculate the HMAC
Go to a free online HMAC generator. In the string box, add the concatenated string you generated in Step 2. Then, input the HMAC key you obtained in Step 3 into the "secret key" field and then select SHA-512 as the digest algorithm, and click on Compute to calculate the HMAC.

Step 5: Compare the Calculated HMAC
Compare the HMAC value you calculated with the hmac value received in the callback to verify the integrity and authenticity of the data.

By following these steps, you can ensure that each callback from Accept is authentic and that the data has not been tampered with during transmission.

HMAC Processed Callback
Please follow below steps to Calculate and Validate the HMAC Processed Callback

Step 1: Sort the Data Lexicographically by Key
Sort the parameters received in the callback in lexicographical order based on their keys. The keys/parameters should be in the same order as shown in the list below.

HMAC String Keys:

Plain Text
amount_cents
created_at
currency
error_occured
has_parent_transaction
obj.id
integration_id
is_3d_secure
is_auth
is_capture
is_refunded
is_standalone_payment
is_voided
order.id
owner
pending
source_data.pan
source_data.sub_type
source_data.type
success

Step 2: Concatenate the Values
Concatenate the values of the keys/parameters into a single string in the same order as they are listed. This string will be used to calculate the HMAC in the next step. For example, if we consider the sample transaction processed callback, the resultant string would look like this:

HMAC Concatenated String:

Plain Text
1000002024-06-13T11:33:44.592345EGPfalsefalse1920364654097558truefalsefalsefalsetruefalse217503754302852false2346MasterCardcardtrue

Step 3: Get the HMAC Value
Obtain the HMAC value from the Merchant Portal settings tab under account information. Use this HMAC value as the secret key in the following steps.


Step 4: Calculate the HMAC
Go to a free online HMAC generator. In the string box, add the concatenated string you generated in Step 2. Then, input the HMAC key you obtained in Step 3 into the "secret key" field and then select SHA-512 as the digest algorithm, and click on Compute to calculate the HMAC.

HMAC Calculated Sample:

Plain Text
fa8ac0b7f3852e60c50e7fdd4ea5ef0bda96030c19dea1d55df8c76d6c08ab1877774662cbb049
81dc84839ad4da560bcc8cb53b8973548657f7e8f8d2e79930

Step 5: Compare the Calculated HMAC
Compare the HMAC value you calculated with the hmac value received in the query strings of the callback to verify the integrity and authenticity of the data.

So the total results should be like as mentioned in the “Transaction Processed Callback Sample. By following these steps, you can ensure that each callback from Accept is authentic and that the data has not been tampered with during transmission.

HMAC Redirection Callback
Please follow below steps to Calculate and Validate the HMAC Redirection Callback

Step 1: Sort the Data Lexicographically by Key
Sort the parameters received in the callback in lexicographical order based on their keys. The keys/parameters should be in the same order as shown in the list below.

HMAC String Keys for redirect:

Plain Text
amount_cents
created_at
currency
error_occured
has_parent_transaction
id
integration_id
is_3d_secure
is_auth
is_capture
is_refunded
is_standalone_payment
is_voided
order.id
owner
pending
source_data.pan
source_data.sub_type
source_data.type
success

Step 2: Concatenate the Values
Concatenate the values of the keys/parameters into a single string in the same order as they are listed. This string will be used to calculate the HMAC in the next step. For example, if we consider the sample transaction processed callback, the resultant string would look like this:

HMAC Concatenated String:

Plain Text
2000002024-07-21T113A253A08.633747EGPfalsefalse2019728981996388falsefalsefalsefalsetruefalse228276342310964false01010101010walletwallettrue

Step 3: Get the HMAC Value
Obtain the HMAC value from the Merchant Portal settings tab under account information. Use this HMAC value as the secret key in the following steps.


Step 4: Calculate the HMAC
Go to a free online HMAC generator. In the string box, add the concatenated string you generated in Step 2. Then, input the HMAC key you obtained in Step 3 into the "secret key" field and then select SHA-512 as the digest algorithm, and click on Compute to calculate the HMAC.

HMAC Calculated Sample:

Plain Text
0b895bb897fb000095a5a3cbadfdbcf79011d8b223e52cd6a6d68f4f6291f4f5f27fb52fe5c27b40c7462d302cf410967299c264712bb783650d520001eee876

Step 5: Compare the Calculated HMAC
Compare the HMAC value you calculated with the hmac value received in the url of the callback to verify the integrity and authenticity of the data.

So the total results should be like as mentioned in the “Transaction Response Callback Sample. By following these steps, you can ensure that each callback from Accept is authentic and that the data has not been tampered with during transmission.

HMAC Card Token Object
Please follow the steps below to calculate and validate the HMAC Card Token Object. If you are saving cards and using them as tokens, you will receive token objects containing the card details and their corresponding tokens. Additionally, the token object's HMAC will be provided as a query parameter."

Step 1: Sort the Data Lexicographically by Key
Sort the parameters received in the callback in lexicographical order based on their keys. The keys/parameters should be in the same order as shown in the list below.

HMAC String Keys for Card Token Object:

Plain Text
card_subtype
created_at
email
id
masked_pan
merchant_id
order_id
token

Step 2: Concatenate the Values
Concatenate the values of the keys/parameters into a single string in the same order as they are listed. This string will be used to calculate the HMAC in the next step. For example, if we consider the sample of Card Token Object, the resultant string would look like this:

HMAC Concatenated String:

Step 3: Get the HMAC Value
Obtain the HMAC value from the Merchant Portal settings tab under account information. Use this HMAC value as the secret key in the following steps.


Step 4: Calculate the HMAC
Go to a free online HMAC generator. In the string box, add the concatenated string you generated in Step 2. Then, input the HMAC key you obtained in Step 3 into the "secret key" field and then select SHA-512 as the digest algorithm, and click on Compute to calculate the HMAC.

Step 5: Compare the Calculated HMAC
Compare the HMAC value you calculated with the hmac value received in the query strings of the Card token callback to verify the integrity and authenticity of the data.

So the total results should be like as mentioned in the “Card Token Object Callback Sample. By following these steps, you can ensure that each callback from Accept is authentic and that the data has not been tampered with during transmission.

Note: Try to implement a logic that calculates the HMAC out of the up-mentioned Card token oject, and if you got the same results, add this logic to your Card token object endpoints.
